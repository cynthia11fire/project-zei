# Project Zei – Multi-Agent Architecture for Next-Gen Virtual Idols

Zei is a single virtual idol powered by a modular multi-agent system.  
Although users interact with only one character, Zei is orchestrated internally by three coordinated AI modules, enabling consistent personality, emotional depth, and narrative stability.

This structure solves the common problems of identity drift, tone inconsistency, and broken narrative flow in traditional single-model virtual characters.
